# Retail sentiment (ops + architecture)

What retail investors are saying about the stocks a user holds and watches, plus
a market-wide view. Scores are free; the evidence behind them is Pro.

Extends the existing `Insights/` module rather than replacing it. `HermesSyncJob`
keeps pulling the raw firehose every 15 minutes; a separate daily job turns those
posts into materialized aggregates.

## The one switch that matters

```bash
DEEPAPI_SOCIAL_SCRAPING_ENABLED=true
```

With this **off**, the DeepAPI provider declares no sentiment sources at all and
the chain falls through to direct APIs. Before this feature it silently scored
web-search snippets instead — press sentiment wearing a retail label, which
looks healthy on every dashboard while measuring the wrong population.

Set `true` in `norviq-infra/apps/api/values-{staging,production}.yaml`. Defaults
to `false` locally because scrape runs cost orders of magnitude more than a web
search and will drain a small balance in one sync.

## Data model

| Table | Purpose | Retention |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `ticker_sentiment_posts` | Raw posts, one row per post. Gained a `source` column. | 90d (`SENTIMENT_POST_RETENTION_DAYS`) |
| `symbol_sentiment_daily` | One materialized aggregate per symbol per day. The read path. | 730d (`SENTIMENT_DAILY_RETENTION_DAYS`) |
| `sentiment_universe_symbols` | Which symbols the job is responsible for, and at what tier. | — |
| `sentiment_snapshots` | Pre-existing topic/overall snapshots. Untouched. | — |

`symbol_sentiment_daily.score` is **nullable, and null is load-bearing**: it
means no chatter was measured, which is not the same as a balanced crowd. Every
client renders absence distinctly and must never substitute a zero. `postCount`
still counts unscoreable posts — they are chatter even when they carry no
sentiment term.

Nothing pruned any of these tables before this work, in a codebase that retires
scenario runs, assistant transcripts and expense imports on a timer. Post text
is unbounded `TEXT` and the universe expansion multiplies daily row count by
roughly forty, so `SentimentRetentionJob` is load-bearing, not tidying.

## The symbol universe

Three tiers, spent in priority order. `SentimentUniverseResolver` rebuilds Tier A
every run from live holdings and watchlists, so a symbol added this morning is
covered tonight.

| Tier | Membership | Sources | LLM themes | Limit |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `user` | Union of all users' holdings + non-archived watchlists, plus `HERMES_TRACKED_TICKERS` pins | all | yes | `SENTIMENT_USER_TIER_LIMIT` (500) |
| `sp500` | Index membership | cheap only | no | list size |
| `trending` | Surfaced by the firehose, held by nobody | cheap only | no | `SENTIMENT_TRENDING_TIER_LIMIT` (50) |

Before this, the universe was a global **top-25 by holder count**, so a user's
long-tail holdings were never ingested at all.

### Tier B is configured, not hardcoded

Set either:

```bash
SENTIMENT_SP500_SYMBOLS=AAPL,MSFT,...   # explicit, wins
FMP_API_KEY=...                          # fetched from FMP's constituent endpoint
```

Neither set means Tier B stays empty and the universe is user symbols only —
coverage degrades, nothing breaks. A constituent list baked into the binary
would be wrong within months, and wrong *silently*: a missing symbol is
indistinguishable from a quiet one.

## Provider chain

```
Hermes (self-hosted, tailnet) -> DeepAPI -> Direct APIs -> Disabled
```

| Provider | Sources | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Hermes | X | Self-hosted VPS, free at the margin |
| DeepAPI | X, Reddit, StockTwits, Investing.com, Seeking Alpha | Only path to the last two; gated on `DEEPAPI_SOCIAL_SCRAPING_ENABLED` |
| Direct | StockTwits, Reddit, news | Free or already paid for. No Investing.com / Seeking Alpha — they have no free API |

The direct link exists so an exhausted DeepAPI balance **thins** coverage instead
of stopping sentiment. StockTwits and Finnhub news need no extra config; Reddit
needs a script app (`REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`).

StockTwits users self-tag Bullish/Bearish. That is a stated stance from the
author, so it is trusted over the lexicon — but at 0.8 confidence, not 1.0, since
it is still one data point.

See `stocktwits.md` for how we reach StockTwits, and why their MCP server cannot
back the app.

### A provider that answers with nothing

`firstSuccess` used to return the first provider that did not **throw**. Not
throwing is a weaker signal than it looks: a degraded upstream answers HTTP 200
with an empty body, that counted as success, and the rest of the chain was never
consulted — its cooldown was even cleared.

This was live on 2026-09-07. Hermes is first in production and its scraper had
died, so it answered every call with zero posts. Nothing threw, so nothing fell
through, so DeepAPI and the keyless StockTwits feed behind it never ran. Retail
sentiment stopped ingesting entirely while the daily job reported
`sentiment_aggregation ok ... posts_fetched=0 posts_inserted=0 rows=33`, and the
read path — Postgres-only, never touching a provider — kept serving 200s off
ageing rows. It looked like thin coverage, not an outage.

`firstSuccess` now takes an `isUsable` predicate (default: accept anything, so
other call sites are unchanged). `fetchSymbolPosts` passes "at least one batch
has a post". An unusable value is logged and falls through; the last one is
returned only when nobody did better, because an empty answer from a provider
willing to answer beats an error from one that was not.

The aggregation job now **warns** rather than informs when a run upserts rows off
zero fetched posts.

This was the same defect the AI provider chain had. If you add a third chain,
decide up front what "usable" means for it.

### Credit exhaustion

Previously `insufficient_credits` was flattened into a generic `Abort` — fine as
failover, useless as a signal. A dry account and a network blip produced
identical logs, and `FallbackInsightsProvider.health` aggregates with `any`, so
the chain reported green while the paid tier had been skipped for days.

Now it throws a typed `InsightsProviderError.creditsExhausted`, which:

1. still falls through to the next provider, and
2. puts that provider in cooldown for `PROVIDER_CREDIT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (6h).

Without the cooldown, a universe sweep rediscovers the dry balance on every one
of its hundreds of calls, each costing a request that cannot succeed. A later
success clears it early.

The registry is in-process, not Redis-backed: Redis is optional here and disabled
outright under `.testing`, and a cooldown that silently does nothing in tests is
worse than one with a known limit. The limit is one wasted call per replica per
window.

## Scoring: hybrid

**Stage 1 — `SentimentClassifier`, every post.** Pure, synchronous, no I/O.

This replaced three divergent lexicons inside `DeepAPIInsightsProvider` (one for
web snippets, one for tweets, one for Reddit) that disagreed on thresholds, on
vocabulary, and on what a score of zero meant. Three behaviours changed
deliberately:

- **Word-boundary matching.** The old scorers used `contains`, so `"up"` fired on
  *supply*, *disruption* and *upset*, and `"down"` fired on *download*. Only
  phrases and emoji are substring-matched now.
- **Negation.** "not bullish" previously scored bullish.
- **Confidence measures evidence.** The old value was `min(1, abs(score) * 2)` —
  a restatement of the score wearing a different name.

Scores saturate via `sum / (abs(sum) + 2)` rather than running away, and
aggregation is confidence-weighted so one ambiguous word does not move a symbol
as far as five unambiguous ones.

**Stage 2 — `SentimentThemeService`, Tier A only.** One OpenAI call per symbol
over the day's top ~40 posts, `response_format: json_object`. Follows the split
already used by `DefaultAIInsightsService`: the server computes every number, the
model only names and narrates. A theme failure leaves `themes` null and the row
still ships its score.

Skipped entirely when `app.openAIChatClient` is `DisabledOpenAIChatClient`.

## Jobs

| Job | Cadence | Guard |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `HermesSyncJob` | 900s (unchanged) | provider enabled |
| `SentimentAggregationJob` | hourly tick, runs once per UTC day | provider enabled, not `.testing` |
| `SentimentRetentionJob` | daily | not `.testing` |

The daily cadence is built on an hourly tick that no-ops unless
`SENTIMENT_AGGREGATION_HOUR_UTC` has passed and today's date has not been
completed. A naive 24-hour interval would let a pod that restarts at 04:00 every
day never reach its first tick.

Both new jobs skip scheduling under `.testing`. A test app migrates and reverts
its schema inside one process; a timer that outlives a suite and then deletes
from tables that no longer exist turns an unrelated test into a crash. Both
expose `runOnce(_ app:)`.

`HermesSyncJob` and `SentimentAggregationJob` stay separate on purpose — merging
them would tie the cheap 15-minute pull to the expensive once-a-day LLM pass, and
either failing would take the other down.

## API

All under `/v1/insights`, scope `insights:read`, rate limited 60/60s by the
existing group.

| Route | Gating |
|-------|--------|
| `GET /sentiment/symbols?symbols=AAPL,MSFT` | free, ≤100 symbols |
| `GET /sentiment/portfolio?portfolioListId=` | free |
| `GET /sentiment/watchlist?watchlistListId=` | free |
| `GET /sentiment/trending?limit=20` | free |
| `GET /sentiment/history/{symbol}?limit=30` | **Pro** |
| `GET /tickers/{symbol}/sentiment` (pre-existing) | **Pro** |
| `POST /sentiment/sync` | admin (`INSIGHTS_ADMIN_EMAILS`) |
| `POST /sentiment/seed-index` | admin |

The free/Pro line is **aggregate vs evidence**. Free endpoints return score,
label, counts, delta and coverage — never post text or LLM themes. The score is
what makes someone open the app; the reasoning behind it is the paid product.

Reads never touch a provider. Everything is served from Postgres, so a scraping
outage costs freshness, never latency.

### Roll-up weighting

Portfolio is **value-weighted** (`shares × live quote`, falling back to cost
basis when a quote is missing). Sentiment on a 40% position and a 0.5% position
are not equally relevant to the owner.

Watchlist is **equal-weighted** — there are no position sizes to weight by, and
inventing one would be a lie.

`coverage` is not cosmetic. The weighted score is computed over only the
positions that carry a reading, so a score drawn from 2 of 10 holdings would
otherwise read as portfolio-wide. Every client renders coverage alongside the
score and flags it below 50%.

### Trending ranks by `volumeZ`, not post count

Chatter volume relative to each symbol's *own* trailing baseline. Ranking by raw
count would return the same megacaps every day — AAPL always out-posts a small
cap. `volumeZ` is null below 5 days of history: with two data points the standard
deviation is noise, and a fabricated z-score would rank a brand-new symbol
straight to the top.

## Clients

**Web** (`norviq-web`): badges on holding and watchlist rows via a batch fetch at
the existing `loadPortfolioMarketEnrichment` seam, roll-up on the portfolio hero
and watchlist, daily reading + themes + 30-day chart on the stock detail tab,
and `/markets/sentiment`.

**iOS** (`norviq-ios`): `RetailSentimentBadge` on rows, `PortfolioSentimentCard`,
`MarketSentimentScreen` under Markets, and the detail tab extended with a daily
card and a Swift Charts history.

Two client-side rules worth keeping:

- Sentiment is a **daily** aggregate. Keep it off the 20s quote-refresh timer —
  fetch once per load and on pull-to-refresh.
- The history chart pins its Y axis to the full −100…100 range. Auto-scaling
  turns a week of near-neutral noise into a dramatic-looking swing, which is
  exactly the misreading it must not invite.

## Ops

Force a run without waiting for the scheduler:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.norviq.org/v1/insights/sentiment/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_JWT"
```

Returns counts for symbols considered/ingested/failed, posts fetched/inserted,
rows upserted, and themes generated/skipped.

Seed or refresh Tier B:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.norviq.org/v1/insights/sentiment/seed-index \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_JWT"
```

### Cost

The per-symbol LLM call is the only per-symbol AI spend, capped by
`SENTIMENT_MAX_THEME_SYMBOLS` (150) on top of the existing `AIDailyCap`. Tiers B
and C never reach the LLM. Scrape spend is bounded per call by
`DEEPAPI_MAX_COST_USD` and per run by the tier limits.

### Diagnosing a quiet feature

1. `posts_fetched=0` in `sentiment_aggregation` → nothing is ingesting at all.
   Check that line first; it warns rather than informs when this happens. The
   usual cause is the first provider in the chain answering with nothing (grep
   `returned nothing usable`, and `hermes_sync ticker feed returned nothing`).
   A 200 from `/v1/insights/sentiment/*` proves nothing here — reads never touch
   a provider.
2. `postCount` 0 everywhere → check `DEEPAPI_SOCIAL_SCRAPING_ENABLED`.
3. Scores present but only from `news` → DeepAPI is likely in credit cooldown;
   grep logs for `is out of credit`.
4. A specific symbol has no reading → check it is in
   `sentiment_universe_symbols`; only Tier A is rebuilt automatically.
5. Trending empty but symbols have scores → `volumeZ` needs 5 days of history per
   symbol before it is populated.

## Not advice

Sentiment describes what retail investors are posting, not whether they are
right. Every surface carries a disclaimer, and the LLM prompt forbids
recommendations, price targets and predictions.
